# Methods

### R documentation
Search a package manual from CRAN, e.g. [dplyr documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf).

### Vignettes

A vignette is like a book chapter or an academic paper: it can describe the problem that a package is designed to solve, and then show the reader how to solve it. A vignette should divide functions into useful categories, and demonstrate how to coordinate multiple functions to solve problems. Usage:

`browseVignettes("pkg_name")` or `vignette("pkg_name")`

---
# Methods (Cont')

### Get help from RStudio 
- Find explanations and examples from RStudio
    - `help(function)` or `help(package = "pkg_name")`
    - `?pkg_name::function` or `?function`
    - `example("function")`
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
example("mean")
```

# Where to Get Help

.pull-left[
**Stats Consulting Group** `r emo::ji("smile")`

.large[
- Help writing code to perform an analysis in R
  - Examples: GLMs, mixed models, PCA, etc
  
- Help creating visualizations (non-publishable versions)

- Interpreting output

- Issues with conflicting output

]

.pull-right[
**Internet Resources**

.large[
- Sites such as:
  - [Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4544/how-does-one-do-a-type-iii-ss-anova-in-r-with-contrast-codes)
  - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58980605/correctly-specify-paired-data-in-lmer-mixed-model-in-r)
  - [R Studio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

- Make sure to try your best to find the answer before posting

- Important to post a clear question and a reprex (see upcoming slides)

- Directly contact R package developer (via [GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/issues) or [email](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html))
]

# Keep in Mind

- Try to find the answer yourself first

- Provide a .blue[**focused question**] helps with the process 
  
  - Importance of asking the right question
  - Both for R related and general questions
  
- Take into consideration the consultant's/package developer's/etc time

- Provide a .blue[**reprex**] (.blue[**repr**]oducible .blue[**ex**]ample)

  - "The .blue[**goal of a reprex**] is to package your problematic code in such a way that other people can run it and feel your pain. Then, hopefully, they can provide a solution and put you out of your misery." - [Tidyverse help page](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

# Parts of a reprex

[From RStudio community FAQ](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219): 

.large[

- **Background information**
  - Describe what you are trying to do. What have you already done?
  
- **Complete set up**
  - Include any library() calls and data to reproduce your issue.
  
- **Make it run**
  - People should be able to copy and paste your code chunk and get the same error.
  
- **Minimal** 
  - Strip away everything that is not directly related to your problem.
  
]

---

# Reproducible Example (or reprex)

**Creating a reprex is not always easy:**

- Requires pinpointing the problem in the code

- Requires crafting a small example that someone else can easily run on their computer

- Often enough time is spent creating a reprex that an answer is encountered prior to asking someone else the question!

# Example 1

Dear Consultant, 

I have written some R code, and it won't run. I've attached the data and R script. Help!

Many thanks,  
A. Client

# Example 2

Dear Consultant, 

I've been trying to use the code you wrote for me and apply it to a different dataset, but I am running into problems. Could you please help me? Here is the code:

.medium[
*df_clean <-*   
  *df_raw %>%*  
  *select(-dont_need1, -dont_need2) %>%*  
  *mutate(trt = factor(trt)) %>%*  
  *pivot_longer(names_to = "week", values_to = "y", cols = -c(year, trt))*
  
*df_clean %>%*  
  *filter(year == "2019") %>%*  
  *groupby(trt, week) %>%*  
  *summarise(mean = mean(y), sd = sd(y))*
]

Many thanks,  
A. Client

# Example 3

Dear Consultant, 

I am trying to fit a linear regression model like we talked about in our last meeting. I am having some difficulties with the R code. I've attached a small example that demonstrates my error. Could you take a quick look when you have the chance?

Many thanks,  
A. Client

.large[
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Example dataset
df = data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100, 10, 3),
  trt = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50)
)

# Here is where the error occurs
m = lm(df, y, trt)
```

# Working with data

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.navy {
  color: #000050;
}
```

- All data should be described <u>both quantitatively and qualitatively</u>
- Don't forget to .navy[**visualize your data**]
    - Summary stats don't give a full picture
    - E.g., The [DatasauRus Dozen](https://github.com/lockedata/datasauRus) all have the same summary stats and zero correlation

# Tips for visualization

- Use base R for quick visualizations

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(diamonds)
hist(diamonds$price)
plot(x = diamonds$carat, y = diamonds$price, main = "Price by Carat")
```

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(diamonds$price)
plot(x = diamonds$carat, y = diamonds$price, main = "Price by Carat")
```

---

# Tips for visualization

- Use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for complex or customized visualizations

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10}
data(diamonds)
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 1) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 12)
```
