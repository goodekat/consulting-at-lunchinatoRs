#  Helping Yourself

---
#  Methods

### R documentation
Search a package manual from CRAN, e.g. [dplyr documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf).

### Vignettes

A vignette is like a book chapter or an academic paper: it can describe the problem that a package is designed to solve, and then show the reader how to solve it. A vignette should divide functions into useful categories, and demonstrate how to coordinate multiple functions to solve problems. Usage:

`browseVignettes("pkg_name")` or `vignette("pkg_name")`

---
#  Methods (Cont')

### Get help from RStudio 
- Find explanations and examples from RStudio
    - `help(function)` or `help(package = "pkg_name")`
    - `?pkg_name::function` or `?function`
    - `example("function")`
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
example("mean")
```

> The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The target learner:
> 
> * Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.
> * Is largely self-taught.
> * Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow them down or make their work products more brittle.
> * Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and more self-sufficient.

# Working with data

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.navy {
  color: #000050;
}
```

- All data should be described <u>both quantitatively and qualitatively</u>
- Don't forget to .navy[**visualize your data**]
    - Summary stats don't give a full picture
    - E.g., The [DatasauRus Dozen](https://github.com/lockedata/datasauRus) all have the same summary stats and zero correlation

# Tips for visualization

- Use base R for quick visualizations

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(diamonds)
hist(diamonds$price)
plot(x = diamonds$carat, y = diamonds$price, main = "Price by Carat")
```

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(diamonds$price)
plot(x = diamonds$carat, y = diamonds$price, main = "Price by Carat")
```

---

# Tips for visualization

- Use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for complex or customized visualizations

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10}
data(diamonds)
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 1) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 12)
```

# Additional tools

- [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
    - <u>Organized</u>: self-contained file of code and output (HTML, PDF, or Word)
    - <u>Flexible</u>: include paragraphs, figures, tables, LaTeX equations, etc.
    - <u>Convenient</u>: scroll through results that have already been run
- The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) "ecosystem" of packages
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
